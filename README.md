#Keeper App
Designed a Kepper App using ReactJs Hooks to keep track of user day-to-day notes.
Made the Web-App more responsive and interactive by using Bootstrap and CSS. Implemented features to add notes with proper title and delete as per the requirement.
Simplified Html DOM tree traversal, manipulation, and event handling using jQuery.
